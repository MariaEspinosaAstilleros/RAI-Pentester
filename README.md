# RAI - Python for Pentester

**Exercise 1:** Create a Python script that prints all the forms and links of a web page sent by argument to the program.

**Exercise 2:** Create a tool to perform the following tasks:
1. Given an IP address or a domain name, find information related to the owner of that domain and the corresponding DNS records. 
2. Run a scan with Nmap against the target and subsequently, obtain more information from the target using Shodan.
3. In the case of finding ports that are frequently related to web servers (80, 8080, 443) perform an HTTP request using the OPTIONS method to determine if indeed, the target is a web server and extract the supported HTTP methods.


## Tools üõ†Ô∏è
* BeautifulSoup library
* Python Whois library
* DNS library
* Request HTTP library
* Nmap library
* Shodan library

## Execution instructions ‚öôÔ∏è
Both exercises have a help message to know the flags required for their execution with the `-h` tag.

```shell 
python3 <name_exercise> -h
```
### Exercise 1
For this exercise it is only necessary to enter the domain of a web page by command line, so run:

```shell 
python3 exercise1.py -d <url_webpage>
```

### Exercise 2
For this exercise it is necessary to enter the desired IP address and its corresponding domain via command line. To obtain the domain owner information with `Whois` and its corresponding DNS records run

```shell 
python3 exercise2.py -d <url_webpage>
```

On the other hand, to perform a port scan with the `Nmap` tool and get more information from the user with the `Shodan` tool run

```shell 
python3 exercise2.py -i <ip_address> -d <url_webpage>
```

taking into account that you must enter the IP corresponding to the domain of the web page you enter.
